# LEIA Project Survey Dashboard

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deppen8/leiap_dashboard/master?urlpath=proxy%2F5006%2Fbokeh-app)

This dashboard can be used interactively in Binder.

I based this repo on a [well-documented example](https://github.com/binder-examples/bokeh) from Binder. Many thanks to @minrk for developing this solution and [sharing it with the world](https://github.com/minrk/binder-bokeh-server).
